### In here the game has been separated into main.c and mylibrary.c, instead of one main.c file as in LAB01. 

#### Contents:

- a.out - compiled source code using gcc, running in terminal should work
- main.c - main source code
- main.o - compiled main.c
- mylibrary.c - my library with all the functions used in main
- mylibrary.h - header file for mylibrary.c
- mylibrary.o - compiled mylibrary.c
